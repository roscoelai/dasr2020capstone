  #' and weeks will be calculated using available date information.
  #' 
  #' Recognized climate stations:
  #' \enumerate{
  #'   \item Admiralty

  #   records, the following climate stations have been indicated to have 
  #   captured temperature and wind speed data, in addition to rainfall data 
  #   which was common to all stations. Their names are associated with their 
  #   numbers in the following vector.

  # We will enumerate all user-input years with all 12 months by taking the 
  #   Cartesian product of the user-input years with a vector of 12 months 
  #   (from "01" to "12", with leading zeroes). Some stations might not have 
  #   data for certain months (so the .csv file does not exist), but we'll 
  #   handle that using tryCatch().

  #   combinations, remembering the underscore ("_") between the station number 
  #   and the year.

  # It was noted that in some of the column headers, a variant of the "degree 
  #   sign" was used (for the unit degrees Celsius). These were recognized as 
  #   invalid multibyte characters, and somehow made the table contents 
  #   inaccessible. Furthermore, the column headers had slightly different 
  #   wordings after April 2020. Thus, it was decided that the columns names 
  #   would be manually set as each table was read in order to address the 
  #   problems as well as facilitate dplyr::bind_rows() downstream.
  # It was also found that the table might contain the "em dash" (long dash) 
  #   character, also recognized as an invalid multibyte character, to denote 
  #   missing values or empty cells. These would be converted to NA upon type 
  #   coercion using as.numeric().
