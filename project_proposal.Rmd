## Overview of the Project
- Question
  - ?
- Why the question matters
  - Dengue infections -> severe medical condition -> ...
- Why the findings are plausible
  - Rainfall, temperature -> mosquito growth -> ...

## Overview of the Project
- What will be investigated
  - ?
- What the outcome of the investigation will be
  - ?
- Identify your questions (explorative/predictive)
  - In the format of the relationships between X and Y (correlational/causational)
  - ?



## Data
- Provide descriptions of your data
- Where you will find it or have found it
  - [Data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/dataset?q=Dengue)
    - Weekly case numbers 2014 to 2018 (epidemiological weeks?)
    - Geographical locations for past 14 days (GeoJSON? leaflet?)
  - [Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS)](http://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-historical-daily/)
    - Historical daily records
  - Others?
- How you will secure or have secured access (to import the data)
  - ?

## Data
- What key variables are available within your dataset(s) for your analyses
    - ?
- For your dataset search, here are some useful websites that you might want to refer to:
  - [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch)
  - [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/)
- Surely, you may scrape webpages that contain potential evidence for your analyses
- You may use multiple datasets



## Analysis Plan
- How you will transform your datasets to come up with proxies of your X and Y
  - ?
- Further elaborate and identify what would be your analysis
  - ?
- How your analyses answer your proposed questions
  - ?

## Analysis Plan
- What the limits of your analyses would be
  - ?
  - You might want to ponder alternative accounts to your proposed explanation of the phenomena that you analyzed
