## Meeting (08 July 2020)

#### S
- Q1: Case numbers for different diseases across 2012-2020
  - Plot weekly by months for each year - line/bar graph and heat map
  - Compare significant differences between years
- Q2: Weather variables across 2012 - 2020
  - Variables: daily temperature, wind speed, daily total rainfall
  - Aggregate to weekly data - median, mean, min, max, range
  - Plot weekly by months for each year - bar graph and heat map

#### A
- Q3: Correlate case numbers and weather variables in general
  - For each disease to each weather variables
  - Which disease is most related to weather
- Q4: Regression model

# Capstone Project Proposal

![](./imgs/ncases_2012_2020.png)

## Overview
Dengue fever is a vector-borne infectious disease that is endemic in the tropical world. Singapore is one of several countries with high disease burden of dengue. In 2020, Singapore saw 1,158 dengue cases in a week of June - the highest number of weekly dengue cases ever recorded since 2014. Why is there a sudden spike in dengue cases this year?

### Questions
  - Does atmospheric variables influence the incidence of dengue cases?
    - Specifically, is higher humidity, precipitation, or temperature associated with increased numbers of dengue cases?
  - Can atmospheric variables predict the number of dengue cases?
  - Does the number of dengue cases increase with the number of COVID-19 cases?
  - Explain the different number of cases in different regions of Singapore

## <s>Data</s>
(Moved)

## Analysis Plan
- Transform dengue cases data
  - Converting epidemiology weeks cases to monthly cases for 2012 - 2020
  - Combine the different Excel sheets into a table 
- Compare the monthly cases across the years
  - Using repeated-measures ANOVA
  - Plotting
- To understand if atmospheric variables have an influence in the incidence of dengue cases
  - Correlate the weather variables with number of dengue cases monthly across the years
- To test if atmospheric variables predict number of dengue cases
  - Create models for regression
  - Compare the predicted value with actual value
- For the current trend, explain the differences between the number of cases in different regions
  - According to the news report, East region has the largest number of clusters than other parts of Singapore
  - In particular, does Marine Parade and Sembawang (or Queenstown?) have any differences in their weather variable?

### Address
- Time lag: Dengue cases manifest 1-2 weeks after infection
  - Timing adjustments have to be made for ostensibly associated variables
- Seasonal effects
  - "Vector" months (June, July, August, September, October)
- COVID-19 cases vs. dengue cases
  - 90% foreign workers, expect a correlation
  - Compare against number of cases from Apr - Jul 2020
