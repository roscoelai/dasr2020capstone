## Meeting (27 Jul 2020) <- ?
### Agenda

#### Reorganize
- [x] Split analyses into time and space
  - [x] [analyze_time.R](https://github.com/roscoelai/dasr2020capstone/blob/master/src/analyze_time.R)
  - [x] [analyze_space.R](https://github.com/roscoelai/dasr2020capstone/blob/master/src/analyze_space.R)
- [x] Purify (remove non-data-collection-related code from) the import-* scripts
- [x] Organize and upload raw data files
  - [x] MOH bulletin
  - [x] MSS station positions
  - [x] HCI webscraping data
  - [x] HCI data with geocodes
- [x] Create and test online option for import_moh_weekly()
- [x] Rename get_geocodes.R to zipcodes_to_geocodes.R and smooth out workflow
- [x] Do we need to subset the meteorological data? Perhaps not
- [x] Delete intermediate data
- [x] Create read_kmls()
- [x] Edit document up to before Model section
  - [x] analyze_time.R is now obsolete...
- [ ] Bring choropleth into document
  - [ ] analyze_space.R obsolete

#### Temporal
- [ ] How to aggreagate overall/island-wide meteorological data?
  - [ ] <s>Choose 1 climate station (e.g. Changi)</s>
  - [ ] <s>Aggregate climate stations with sufficient data (~4 stations)</s>
  - [x] **ALL** OF IT!
- [ ] Transform meteorological data
  - [ ] Daily -> Weekly aggregation protocol (mean, median)
- [ ] Combine meteorological and epidemiological data
- [ ] Model meteorological variables vs. number of cases
  - [ ] Time displacement (1 week? 2 weeks?)

#### Spatial
- [ ] How to aggregate recent weather data?
  - [ ] Latest 1 month?
  - [ ] Latest 3 weeks?
  - [ ] Latest 2 weeks?
- [x] Combine locality data with:
  - [x] Area
  - [x] Population
  - [x] Dwelling type
  - [x] Number of cases
  - [x] Number of clinics
  - [x] Meteorological data
    - [x] Inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation from 19 stations
- [ ] Transform number of cases to a fairer indicator (n/area, n/pop, etc.)
  - [ ] Standard choropleth weaknesses:
    - [ ] Modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP)
    - [ ] Ecological fallacy
- [ ] Model everything (?) vs. indicator

## Meeting (08 Jul 2020)
#### S

# Capstone Project Proposal

## Overview
Dengue fever is a vector-borne infectious disease that are endemic in the tropical world. Singapore is one of several countries with high disease burden of dengue. In 2020, Singapore saw 1,158 dengue cases in a week of June - the highest number of weekly dengue cases ever recorded since 2014. Why is there a sudden spike in dengue cases this year?

### Questions
  - Does atmospheric variables influence the incidence of dengue cases?
    - Specifically, is higher humidity, precipitation, or temperature associated with increased numbers of dengue cases?
  - Can atmospheric variables predict the number of dengue cases?
  - Does the number of dengue cases increase with the number of COVID-19 cases?
  - Explain the different number of cases in different regions of Singapore



## <s>Data</s>
(Moved)



## Analysis Plan
- Transform dengue cases data
  - Converting epidemiology weeks cases to monthly cases for 2012 - 2020
  - Combine the different Excel sheets into a table 
- Compare the monthly cases across the years
  - Using repeated-measures ANOVA
  - Plotting
- To understand if atmospheric variables have an influence in the incidence of dengue cases
  - Correlate the weather variables with number of dengue cases monthly across the years
- To test if atmospheric variables predict number of dengue cases
  - Create models for regression
  - Compare the predicted value with actual value
- For the current trend, explain the differences between the number of cases in different regions
  - According to the news report, East region has the largest number of clusters than other parts of Singapore
  - In particular, does Marine Parade and Sembawang (or Queenstown?) have any differences in their weather variable?

### Address
- Time lag: Dengue cases manifest 1-2 weeks after infection
  - Timing adjustments have to be made for ostensibly associated variables
- Seasonal effects
  - "Vector" months (June, July, August, September, October)
- COVID-19 cases vs. dengue cases
  - 90% foreign workers, expect a correlation
  - Compare against number of cases from Apr - Jul 2020
